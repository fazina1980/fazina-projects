Deenanath's father was Ganesh Bhatt Bhikoba (Bhikambhatt) Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), a Karhade Brahmin[23] who served as a priest at the famous Mangeshi Temple in Goa.[22] Deenanath's mother Yesubai Rane was his father's mistress[24] belonging to the Devadasi community of Goa,[25][23][26] a matrilineal community of temple artists now known as Gomantak Maratha Samaj.[27] As a Devadasi, Yesubai was a reputed musician. Deenanath's father's surname was Hardikar.[23]: 47–48  Deenanath had taken the surname Mangeshkar, based on the name of his ancestral village, Mangeshi in Goa.[27][25]

Shevanti was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died before his marriage to Shevanti, was Shevanti's older sister.[29] Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.[30]
                
                Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays.
                
                She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.[32]

                In an interview,Lata Mangeshkar herself disclosed on her 84th birthday in September,2013,"Ghulam Haider is truly my Godfather.It was his confidence in me that he fought for me to tuck me into the Hindi Film Industry which otherwise had initially rejected me.Remembering her early rejection,Lata once said," Ghulam Haiderwas the first music director who showed complete faith in my talent.He introduced me to many film producers including S. Mukherji,a big name in film production,but when he said my voice was "too thin" to use in his film,Ghulam Haider was furious.Hence,finally he convinced Bombay Talkies,a banner bigger than S. Mukherji and introduced me through their movie Majboor (1948).Lata's first big breakthrough film song,was "Dil mera tora,mujhe kaheen ka na chhora teray pyaar ne" lyrics by Nazim Panipati,composed by Ghulam Haider.
